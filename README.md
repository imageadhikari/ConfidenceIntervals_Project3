# Confidence Intervals Project 3
This project was done to fulfill the project 3 requirements for the course CISC 820 - Quantitative Foundations.

In this project, we experiment with different confidence intervals. optimization methods on the given functions. The three optimization methods and one additional method are:
1. Gradient Descent
2. Newton's Method
3. Quasi Newton Method
4. Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) (Optional)

## Reproducing the Project

To reproduce this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/imageadhikari/ConfidenceIntervals_Project3.git
   ```

2. Make sure this is the working directory in matlab.
 
3. Execute the script:
    ```bash
    project_3; 
    ```

## Results:
The results for the different distributions can be found in the [Results](./Results/) folder.
